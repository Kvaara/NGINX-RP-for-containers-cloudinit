    #? This sets the "Host" header to be $host
    #? The "Host" header specifies the host name and port number of server to which the request is being sent to.
    #? In this example, the $host variable would be localhost if user makes a request to localhost
    #? REMEMBER, if the client makes a connection to www.localhost.com/jenkins, the $host WILL STILL be www.localhost.com
    #? The path component ("/jenkins") is not included in the $host variable.
    #? If the request does not include a Host header, or if the Host header is set to a different value than the actual host name of the
    #? upstream server, the upstream server may not be able to properly handle the request.

    # Good routing practice because this ensures that the backend server (e.g., Jenkins) gets the REAL IP Address and not 
    # a proxy/load-balancer's IP address that sits in front of NGINX server.
    # Without this, NGINX sets a default source IP address that will be from the client that connects to NGINX. Hence why the above point.
    # This is more NGINX specific way than the X-Forwarded-For, which is a more De Facto standard way.

    # IP address as requests pass through intermediate proxies or load balancers. 
    # By setting this header, NGINX is telling the backend server the IP address of the original client that made the request, 
    # rather than the IP address of NGINX itself. The $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for parameter tells NGINX to append the client 
    # IP address to any existing X-Forwarded-For header, rather than overwriting it.
